Experiments with OpenGL

Just a dump of my initial experiments with OpenGL while I was working with Tobias Ritschel's group, trying to get a grip on the Plexus platform. The experiments here follow some of the tutorials over at open.gl
Coding was done on QT Creater, although GLUT was used for managing windows. If you want to run these on your system, look at the dependencies in the .pro file and write an appropriate makefile or compile it as a project in some IDE.

The experiments cover vertex array objects, vertex buffer objects, element buffer objects, GLSL, framebuffers and so on. The documentation that accompanies the code is rather poor.
